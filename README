About

Peg, Parsing Expression Grammar, is an implementation of a Packrat parser
generator. A Packrat parser is a descent recursive parser capable of
backtracking. The generated parser searches for the correct parsing of the
input.

This Go implementation is based on:

bootstrap/main.go: bootstrap syntax tree of peg
peg.go: syntax tree and code generator
main.go: bootstrap main
peg.peg: peg in its own language


Testing

There should be no differences between the bootstrap and self compiled:

./peg -inline -switch peg.peg
diff bootstrap.peg.go peg.peg.go


Usage

-inline
 Tells the parser generator to inline parser rules.
-switch
 Reduces the number of rules that have to be tried for some pegs.
